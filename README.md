A repository to complete task given on google code_in Just a new repository for completing task given on Google code_in. This repository created by me is for completing a task given on Google Code-in In this repository I committed a JAVA Hello-World file then I changed the for loop in that file to while loop on a branch and merged that branch to master and then I created a file for including in .gitignore and then created .gitignore file and included the file made for including in it. And thus my GCI project got completed.
Thanks for reading!!! I was able to complete this repository by knowing about GitHub from GitHub guide and knowing the beginning of JAVA language which is taught to mee by my brother and in school
